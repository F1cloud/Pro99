“If time and effort has been put into making it a beautiful or abstract or a fascinating piece of art then it is an art form."

The thing I hate the most about advertiseents, 
Modern art is a desaster area


Banksy, a well-known street artistis once stated Some people becaome cops becaus they want to make the world a better place. Some people becomme vandals because they want the world to be a better looking place.

How many of you agree or disagree with his statement?
 Mostly people who do graffitti are called vandals. But nobody tries to see what lies behind theis grafitti behind their art. We normally hea from people, 'grafitti is ugle, irrespopnsible and childish' but that's only if it is done proerly, or even if it is not done properly. Noone takes grafitti as an art or a thought of imagination as an individual, which is portraid as a picture or a painting. Rather we complain or we moan and comment about how th workmanship.
